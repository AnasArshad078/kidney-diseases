            The treatment of kidney disease depends on the underlying cause and the stage of the disease. It's important to note that kidney disease is a broad term that encompasses various conditions affecting the kidneys, such as chronic kidney disease (CKD), acute kidney injury (AKI), and specific kidney disorders.</p>
            <h1>
                Managing Underlying Conditions:
            </h1>
            <ul><li><b>Control blood pressure:</b> High blood pressure is a common cause of kidney disease. Medications like ACE inhibitors or ARBs may be prescribed.</li>
            <li><b>Manage diabetes:</b> For individuals with diabetes, maintaining blood sugar levels within the target range is crucial to prevent kidney damage.</li>
        <li><b>Treat infections:</b> Kidney infections and urinary tract infections need prompt treatment to prevent damage to the kidneys.</li></ul>

        <h1>
            Dialysis:
        </h1>
        <ul>
            <li>In advanced stages of kidney disease, when the kidneys are no longer able to function adequately, dialysis may be necessary. Dialysis is a process that helps filter waste and excess fluids from the blood.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="capture" ><img src="Capture.JPG" alt=""></div>
        <h1>
            Kidney Transplant:
        </h1>
        <ul>
            <li>For some individuals with end-stage kidney disease, a kidney transplant may be a viable option. This involves replacing a diseased kidney with a healthy one from a donor.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>
            Regular Monitoring and Follow-up:
        </h1>
        <ul><li>Regular check-ups and monitoring of kidney function are essential to assess the progression of the disease and adjust treatment as needed.</li></ul>
        <h1>
            Lifestyle Modifications:
        </h1>
        <ul><li><b>Quit smoking:</b> Smoking can worsen kidney disease.</li><li><b>Maintain a healthy weight:</b> Obesity can contribute to the progression of kidney disease.</li>
            <li><b>Exercise regularly:</b> Regular physical activity can help manage blood pressure and overall health.</li></ul>
